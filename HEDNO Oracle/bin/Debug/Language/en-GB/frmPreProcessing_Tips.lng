The main options to consider creating the Pre-Processing Dataset
[Red background means that an existing XDF cannot be located or is unreachable]{0}[Green background means that an existing XDF is located and is unreachable]{0}Instead of Creating the XDF file by fetching data from the SQL Server, the file that's been saved in a previous session is used
View a Data Summary of the dataset, such as Min, Max, Mean, etc.
View Variable Information such as their types and descriptions.
View the Geo-Location Graph as of Pre-Processing's point of view (may contain erroneous latitudes/longitudes outside Greece's region)
Selects all options in the GroupBox
[Transparent background means a new XDF file will be created, so it can be either in Statistics Mode or not]{0}{0}[If the CheckBox is Checked:]{0}[Red background means that the existing XDF is not marked for statistics, hence by checking this, the statistics will be nonsense or fail altogether]{0}[Green background means that the existing XDF is marked for statistics]{0}{0}[If the CheckBox is Not Checked:]{0}[Red background means that the existing XDF is marked for statistics, hence by not checking it, you strip yourself from the option to perform statistics]{0}[Green background means that the existing XDF is not marked for statistics]{0}{0}If selected, then a n% of the clearly labelled data will be marked for Training and a 100-n% for testing purposes in the XDF file{0}Otherwise all clearly labelled data will be marked for Training and all pending projects without a label will be marked for Testing/Prediction.
If selected, then the XDF file is going to be deleted when the form closes, meaning it is going to be unavailable for further and future use
Needs: R Server or equivalent, an active connection to the SQL Server from R (i.e. valid R SQL Connection String){0}Does: Fetches data from the SQL Server and Pre-processes them, exporting an XDF file featuring the Pre-Processed Dataset according to selected options{0}--If Statistics Mode is checked, then a n% of the clearly labelled data will be marked for Training and a 100-n% for testing purposes in the XDF file{0}--Otherwise all clearly labelled data will be marked for Training and all pending projects without a label will be marked for Testing/Prediction.{0}*If 'Show Data Summary' is checked, a Data Summary View of the dataset is shown, containing features such as Min, Max, Mean, etc.{0}*If 'Show Variable Information' is checked, a Variable Information View is shown, containing features such as their types and descriptions.{0}*If 'Show the Geo-Location Graph' is checked, a Geo-Location Graph is shown as of Pre-Processing's point of view (may contain erroneous latitudes/longitudes outside Greece's region)
